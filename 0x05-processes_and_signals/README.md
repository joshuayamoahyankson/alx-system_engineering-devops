Welcome to my ALX Tasks/Projects on linux processes and signals.

Definition: Linux signals are a fundamental aspect of the operating system, providing a mechanism for processes to communicate with each other and respond to various events. Each signal serves a specific purpose, from controlling processes to notifying them about events or requesting specific actions. (Source: https://prateeksrivastav598.medium.com/)
